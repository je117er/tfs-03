{The Dark Knight When the menace known as the Joker wreaks havoc and chaos on the people of Gotham, Batman must accept one of the greatest psychological and physical tests of his ability to fight injustice. /title/tt0468569/ {English Film surpasses the hype We&apos;ve been subjected to enormous amounts of hype and marketing for the Dark Knight. We&apos;ve seen Joker scavenger hunts and one of the largest viral campaigns in advertising history and it culminates with the actual release of the movie.

Everything that&apos;s been said is pretty much spot on. This is the first time I can remember where a summer blockbuster film far surpasses the hype.

For as much action as there is in this movie, it&apos;s the acting that makes it a great piece of work. Between all the punches, explosions and stunt-work is some great dialog work. All the actors have their moments.

Bale&apos;s Batman is the definitive Batman because we see everything in this character finally on film. Martial arts skills, cunning, great tactical thinking, forensic application, technological genius to advance or improve Luscious Fox&apos;s inventions/technological breakthroughs, intimidating personality, and even a little swashbuckling. 

As for Heath, yes he gets credit for his performance as the Joker. But you have to also recognize Jonathan and Chris Nolan for the writing and treatment of the character. It&apos;s not just the fact that Ledger makes the Joker so menacing, but the Nolans have given the character this great manifesto that drives its actions. The Joker&apos;s stance on chaos, order, anarchy, the morality of the average modern human being make the character so interesting psychologically. The Nolans drafted a complex character and only a perfect performance could&apos;ve pulled something like this off. That&apos;s how difficult of a role this was, and that&apos;s why Ledger&apos;s performance is so great.

This isn&apos;t an action movie. It&apos;s a film that explores literary themes of the hero and villain, as well as order and anarchy. Yes, listen to the dialog because it&apos;s all in there. 2008-07-09 00:00:00 +0000 UTC} {2396961 10 1 9} [Action Crime Drama] dc comics,psychopath,clown,criminal mastermind,scarred face PT2H32M [{Christian Bale /name/nm0000288/} {Heath Ledger /name/nm0005132/} {Aaron Eckhart /name/nm0001173/}] [{Christopher Nolan /name/nm0634240/}] [{ /company/co0002663/} { /company/co0159111/} { /company/co0147954/} {Jonathan Nolan /name/nm0634300/} {Christopher Nolan /name/nm0634240/} {David S.

{The Shawshank Redemption Two imprisoned men bond over a number of years, finding solace and eventual redemption through acts of common decency. /title/tt0111161/ {English Some birds aren&apos;t meant to be caged. The Shawshank Redemption is written and directed by Frank Darabont. It is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption. Starring Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman, the film portrays the story of Andy Dufresne (Robbins), a banker who is sentenced to two life sentences at Shawshank State Prison for apparently murdering his wife and her lover. Andy finds it tough going but finds solace in the friendship he forms with fellow inmate Ellis &quot;Red&quot; Redding (Freeman). While things start to pick up when the warden finds Andy a prison job more befitting his talents as a banker. However, the arrival of another inmate is going to vastly change things for all of them.

There was no fanfare or bunting put out for the release of the film back in 94, with a title that didn&apos;t give much inkling to anyone about what it was about, and with Columbia Pictures unsure how to market it, Shawshank Redemption barely registered at the box office. However, come Academy Award time the film received several nominations, and although it won none, it stirred up interest in the film for its home entertainment release. The rest, as they say, is history. For the film finally found an audience that saw the film propelled to almost mythical proportions as an endearing modern day classic. Something that has delighted its fans, whilst simultaneously baffling its detractors. One thing is for sure, though, is that which ever side of the Shawshank fence you sit on, the film continues to gather new fans and simply will never go away or loose that mythical status.

It&apos;s possibly the simplicity of it all that sends some haters of the film into cinematic spasms. The implausible plot and an apparent sentimental edge that makes a nonsense of prison life, are but two chief complaints from those that dislike the film with a passion. Yet when characters are this richly drawn, and so movingly performed, it strikes me as churlish to do down a human drama that&apos;s dealing in hope, friendship and faith. The sentimental aspect is indeed there, but that acts as a counterpoint to the suffering, degradation and shattering of the soul involving our protagonist. Cosy prison life you say? No chance. The need for human connection is never more needed than during incarceration, surely? And given the quite terrific performances of Robbins (never better) &amp; Freeman (sublimely making it easy), it&apos;s the easiest thing in the world to warm to Andy and Red.

Those in support aren&apos;t faring too bad either. Bob Gunton is coiled spring smarm as Warden Norton, James Whitmore is heart achingly great as the &quot;Birdman Of Shawshank,&quot; Clancy Brown is menacing as antagonist Capt. Byron Hadley, William Sadler amusing as Heywood &amp; Mark Rolston is impressively vile as Bogs Diamond. Then there&apos;s Roger Deakins&apos; lush cinematography as the camera gracefully glides in and out of the prison offering almost ethereal hope to our characters (yes, they are ours). The music pings in conjunction with the emotional flow of the movie too. Thomas Newman&apos;s score is mostly piano based, dovetailing neatly with Andy&apos;s state of mind, while the excellently selected soundtrack ranges from the likes of Hank Williams to the gorgeous Le Nozze di Figaro by Mozart.

If you love Shawshank then it&apos;s a love that lasts a lifetime. Every viewing brings the same array of emotions - anger - revilement - happiness - sadness - inspiration and a warmth that can reduce the most hardened into misty eyed wonderment. Above all else, though, Shawshank offers hope - not just for characters in a movie - but for a better life and a better world for all of us. 10/10 2010-07-24 00:00:00 +0000 UTC} {2440934 10 1 9.3} [Drama] wrongful imprisonment,based on the works of stephen king,prison,escape from prison,voice over narration PT2H22M [{Tim Robbins /name/nm0000209/} {Morgan Freeman /name/nm0000151/} {Bob Gunton /name/nm0348409/}] [{Frank Darabont /name/nm0001104/}] [{ /company/co0040620/} {Stephen King /name/nm0000175/} {Frank Darabont /name/nm0001104/}] 1994-10-14 00:00:00 +0000 UTC}

{The Godfather An organized crime dynasty&apos;s aging patriarch transfers control of his clandestine empire to his reluctant son. /title/tt0068646/ {English Amazing movie The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.

The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get. 2020-01-22 00:00:00 +0000 UTC} {1689774 10 1 9.2} [Crime Drama] crime family,mafia,patriarch,organized crime,rise to power PT2H55M [{Marlon Brando /name/nm0000008/} {Al Pacino /name/nm0000199/} {James Caan /name/nm0001001/}] [{Francis Ford Coppola /name/nm0000338/}] [{ /company/co0023400/} { /company/co0255097/} {Mario Puzo /name/nm0701374/} {Francis Ford Coppola /name/nm0000338/}] 1972-03-24 00:00:00 +0000 UTC}
{The Godfather: Part II The early life and career of Vito Corleone in 1920s New York City is portrayed, while his son, Michael, expands and tightens his grip on the family crime syndicate. /title/tt0071562/ {English To call it a sequel is a travesty This movie is way to be good to be labelled a sequel to The Godfather . Rather it is more of a companion piece to the original and the two perfectly compliment each other . IT is both a sequel and prequel showing the rise of the young vito and moral decline of Micheal . Both characters are brought to life with uncanny ability by Robert  DeNiro and Al Pacino . To say that these two are good actors is like saying that a nuclear bomb makes a loud noise and in this movie they prove why they are at the top of their respective crafts .

Al Pacino is the standout in the ensemble cast and its amazing how his eyes have changed from the first part . They are now cold , ruthless and unemotional and betray the price which Micheal Corleone has paid for power .
